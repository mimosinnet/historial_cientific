	\chapter{Presentation}

	AFIN is an interdisciplinary, inter-university and international research group based at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). It focuses on fundamental and applied research in the fields of social sciences, humanities, and health sciences. The group's mission is to explore the complexities of human reproduction and the multifaceted nature of inequality, examining how factors such as age, sex, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, embodiment, nationality, and their intersections affect individuals and societies. Committed to disseminating the results of its research to the public and diverse communities, AFIN brings together experts from diverse disciplinary fields: anthropology (social, cultural and medical), sociology, education, law, medicine, psychology, and social work.\\\
	In 2015, the group inaugurated the AFIN Centre, a pioneering outreach centre endorsed by the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, with the mission to transform research insights into community services. By 2021, Inari Global Social Action- AFIN was established as a legal entity dedicated to providing expert guidance, support, specialized training, and counselling in the realm of human reproduction. This encompasses a broad spectrum of issues related to family dynamics, childhood development, gender identity, sexual and reproductive health, the reproductive cycle, bodily health, and disease. The comprehensive range of services offered by AFIN-UAB is grounded in extensive research spanning social sciences, health, and humanities. The development of applied research and has provided the AFIN-UAB Research Group with specialized expertise to effectively guide, support, train, and counsel both institutions and individuals navigating the complexities of human reproduction.\\\

This award is granted by the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies in recognition of the research work by professors in Catalan public universities and, at the same time, the award contributes to retaining the research talent within the Catalan university system. The award was given to 30 researchers. Marre has been awarded again in the category of humanities for her work on reproductive politics and practices in Spain. With the recognition of ICREA Academia, the 30 professors awarded will receive 40,000 euros annually each, for a period of five years (2020-2024). These distinctions are aimed at university teaching staff who are doing research and teaching, and especially, those who are in the fully active phase and the expansion of their research activity.
